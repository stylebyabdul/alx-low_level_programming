In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:


This program prints the largest of three integers.
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

    Line count will not be checked for this task.


This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years
